However, if you have tried to enter this room before completing your goals, the warp will unlock so you don’t have to travel there again. \nYou can press [Alt+P](/features/special-commands) to check your progress on goal modes.\n\nIf you enable the Progress Helper [header](/seedgen/headers), you can use the [Custom Wheel](/features/custom-wheel) in order to see which objectives you have collected and which one you are still missing.\n\n## All Trees \n\nIn this mode, you will have to visit all 14 Ancestral Trees and collect their pickups. These trees are the 12 skills trees located in Marsh, Howl's Den, Kwolok’s Hollow, Wellspring, Wastes, Pools, Reach, Depths, and Weeping Ridge plus the 2 Ancestral Light trees located in Glades and above Burrows.\n\n## All Wisps \n\nAll Wisps adds the requirement to collect all the wisps, which are located to their normal location. These wisps are the Voice, Memory, Eyes, Strength and Heart respectively from Kwolok in Kwolok’s Hollow, finishing the Reach escape, defeating Mora in Depths, defeating Kwolok in Pools and finishing the Worm's escape in Wastes.\n\n## All Quests \n\nAll Quests adds the requirement to finish every quest in the game. This includes all main quests (mainly collecting the wisps) but also every side quest like Hand to Hand and Rebuilding the Glades. You can view your quest progress on the map screen.  \nIn addition to the Progress Helper's quest status, you can use this [list of quests](/tutorials/misc/quests) to learn about the exact requirements.\n\n## World Tour \n\nWorld Tour adds one pickup called a [relic](/features/new-items) in some areas. You need to collect the relic in every zone that has one. You can tell if a zone has a relic by pressing [Alt+P](/features/special-commands) or opening your map. If the name of an area is red it means you have already collected its relic, white means the area have a relic but you haven't collected it yet and orange text indicates the area you are currently in (if you haven’t collected its relic). The number of relics vary from one seed to another. You can set the probability of a relic spawning per area once you selected this goal in the seed generator.","dir":"/seedgen","path":"/seedgen/goals","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-11-23T12:39:41.337Z","updatedAt":"2023-11-23T12:39:41.337Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1700743216255},"$loki":8},{"slug":"headers","title":"Headers","tags":["seedgen"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Headers allow you to customize certain aspects of the game, like adding items to the item pool, creating custom pickups, and changing states within the game.

You can set up this feature in the [launcher](/features/launcher), by clicking on the three dots at the top and then selecting Chat Control. You will then need to connect to your Twitch account in order to access the configuration tool.\n\n## Commands\n\nOnce you are connected, you will be able to either add a new command or import existing ones by clicking respectively on the ADD COMMAND button or the button next to it and opening a .wotwcc file.\n\nBy clicking on the Add Command button, a new window will open asking for a command name, a trigger and a script.\n* The name is displayed in the Chat Control editor.

Here is the list of functions used by this scripting language:\n* `get(group, state)` returns the value of the specified Uber State. More information on what an Uber State is can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IR1DHnbtO8rydCLEgFh-yp3iRkzZbFAG-EmR5hxrfmU/edit#heading=h.ja4e5amk5hbm). \n* `set(group, state, value)` sets the value of the specified UberState.\n* `var(name, value)` sets the value of a script variable. You can access that value by using vars.name (example: set variable 'foo' to 10 by using `var(\"foo\", 10)` and access by using `vars.foo`. Note that the scope of a variable is limited to the command you are currently editing. If you want to share information between scripts, you will need to write your value to an Uber State instead (all states in the group 9 are unused and specifically added by the randomizer in order to be used that way).\n* `wait(seconds)` wait for the specified amount of time before continuing the script. Note that the script has to finish executing before the command can be called again.\n* `action(id, pressed)` performs the specified action. You can find a list of all possible actions' id [here](https://github.com/ori-community/wotw-rando-client/blob/main/projects/Core/enums/actions.h). This function simulates pressing a button; the pressed argument is used in order to specify if the action is being pressed or released by using respectively true or false. Note that an action won't release by itself: if you want to do a script which makes Ori jump you have to write `action(\"Jump\", true)` to jump, followed by `wait(0.1)` in order to be sure the game will interpret your input and finally `action(\"Jump\", false)` in order to release the Jump action. If you are not adding the releasing action, this will prevent you from jumping again since the game will think you are still holding your jump button.\n* `setVelocity(x, y)` sets Ori's velocity. Positive x values move Ori to the right while negative values move them to the left. Positive y values move Ori upwards and negative values move them downward.\n* `getValocity()` returns Ori current velocity.\n* `random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1.\n* `random(bound)` returns a random number between 0 and the specified bound.\n* `random(min, max)` returns a random number between the specified min and max values.\n\n## Script examples\n\nSet Ori's health to 1 health cell:\n```\nset(15, 11, 10)\n```\n--- \n\nUse the ability in the bottom left slot:\n```\naction(\"Ability1\", true)\nwait(0.1)\naction(\"Ability1\", false)\n```\n--- \n\nSet Ori's velocity to a random value:\n```\nsetVelocity(random(-30, 30), random(-30, 30))\n```\n---\n\nIncrease Ori's energy by 1 :\n```\nset(15, 13, get(15, 13) + 1.0)\n```\n---\n\nInvert control:\n```\nset(15, 110, get(15, 110) == 1 ? 0 : 1)\nset(15, 111, get(15, 111) == 1 ? 0 : 1)\n```\n","dir":"/features","path":"/features/chat-control","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-11-23T12:39:41.337Z","updatedAt":"2023-11-23T12:39:41.337Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1700743216313},"$loki":14},{"slug":"hints","title":"Hints","tags":["feature"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"During the "},{"type":"element","tag":"nuxt-link","props":{"to":"/seedgen"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"seed generation"}]},{"type":"text","value":", you have the option of enabling different hints through the use of "},{"type":"element","tag":"nuxt-link","props":{"to":"/seedgen/headers"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"headers"}]},{"type":"text","value":".

To do so, you first want to [generate a seed](/seedgen) with the Multiplayer/Bingo option from the Generator tab enabled.\n\n![Netcode in gui](/media/netcode.png)\n\nEnabling that option will let you choose which kind of game you want to play from the dropdown just bellow. When you generate a seed from the [Launcher](/features/launcher), you will automatically get redirected to the Game tab. If you aren't connected, you will need to log in by clicking on the top right button. The connection is using [Discord](https://discord.com/) so please download it if you don't already have it.\n\nOnce you are redirected to the Game tab, you can click on the icon next to the game number to copy the link to this specific game in your clipboard and share it with the other players. Opening this link will open the same page as your Game tab in a web browser. They can then open the game in the launcher by clicking on the corresponding button.\n\nFrom here, you will be able to setup each teams by either creating new Universes or joining an already existing one. Click on the Play button from the World you are in when you want to launch your seed.\n\n## Universes and Worlds\n\nOn the Game tab, you should see something like this:\n\n![Universe example](/media/universe.png)\n\nYou will be either able to create a new universe or join a World. A World is each \"box\" inside a universe, which are automatically created when creating a new Universe. Each level have it's specificity:\n\n* Each players inside the same World are playing in [Co-op](/features/multiplayer#co-op) and are sharing their pickups and states. They are playing the same seed.\n* Each players inside the same Universe form a team. They are sharing [Bingo](/features/multiplayer#bingo) goals and different Universes are playing against each others. Different Universes are separated from each other which means players from Universe A can't interact with players from Universe B.\n* Each players inside different World from the same Universe are playing in [Multiworld](/features/multiplayer#multiworld). Everyone is playing in cooperation but players from different Worlds are playing different seeds. \n\n## Co-op\n\nIn Co-op, every player play on the same seed and share pickups so if a player from your team collects a pickup you will get the corresponding item aswell and the pickup will disappear from your game. This mode also shares game states so for example if your teammate opened the second room of Wellspring, it will be open for every other players aswell.\n\nTo play in Co-op, when enabling the Multiplayer option in the [seed generator](/seedgen), more options should show up. Select the Normal option from the dropdown and then generate your seed like any other seed. Then, share the link to your game by clicking on the button next to the game number in order to let the other players access your Game and download the seed. When you are on that page, either create a new Universe or join an already existing World. Every players which are on the same team must join the same World in order to share pickups. Different teams must be in a different Universe.\n\n## Multiworld\n\nMultiworld is a cooperative mode where players are playing on different seeds but you will found items for both you and other players in your own seed. This is different from a normal [co-op](/features/multiplayer#co-op) where when someone found Bash, it gives it to every players since, in multiworld, there is one copy of Bash for every Worlds and founding Bash for World A won't give Bash to players playing in World B. Your next logical progression can be placed in another seed than the one you are playing which means you can be blocked for a bit while waiting for someone else to find you another skill.\n\nTo generate a Multiworld seed, when enabling the Multiplayer option, more options should show up. In the Multiworld worlds names input field, write every worlds' names (press enter every time you finished entering one name) which should also set the dropdown to the Normal setting. Then, [generate your seed](/seedgen) like any other seed. Next, copy the link to your game by cliking on the button next to the game number and share it with the other players in order to let them access your Game. When you are on that page, either create a new Universe or join a World inside an already existing Universe. Every Worlds must have at least one player.\n\nYou can play Multiworld against each other. To do so, every team must be in a different Universe.\n\nYou can also mix Multiworld with [Co-op](/features/multiplayer#co-op). Players can cooperate by playing on the same seed and joining the same World. By doing so, they will share pickups between themselves and will still found and receive pickups for other Worlds from their Universe.\n\n## Bingo\n\nBingo is a mode which gives you a board with 25 objectives to complete. Your goal is to form lines with your completed objectives. It's recommanded to use the Bingo utilities [header](/seedgen/headers) which let you press [Alt+C](/features/special-commands) when you completed enough lines in order to start rolling the credits without having to fight Shriek. The randomizer automaticaly track your progress towards goals and will automaticaly claim goals you completed. Goals can vary from collecting pickups or trees to completing quests or doing specific actions like killing ennemies or rolling the snowball in Reach.\n\nIn order to generate a bingo seed, you first want to [generate a seed](/seedgen) with the Multiplayer option enabled. Select the Bingo variant you want to play with from the dropdown and then [generate your seed](/seedgen) like any other seed. Then, click on the button next to your game number in order to copy the link to your game and share it to the other players so they can join your Game. When you are on that page, either create a new Universe or join an already existing World. Every players whithin the same World will be playing in [Co-op](/features/multiplayer#co-op) and will be sharing goals. Players from different Universe are playing against each others.\n\nIt's also possible to mix [Multiworld](/features/multiplayer#multiworld) with Bingo. To do so, you need to generate a Multiworld seed but instead of selecting the Normal option from the dropdown, select the kind of bingo you want to play. Each players whithin the same Universe will be sharing their goals.\n\nBingo have two different variants, which each add a little twist:\n\n### Discovery bingo\n\nDiscovery Bingo is a variant of bingo where most goals will be hidden at first. This is the same as a normal bingo except that only 2 goals will be displayed from the 25 goals at first. When you complete one goal, the goal adjacent to the one you finished will be revealed. The autotracker will keep track of your progress towards hidden goals but they won't show up on the grid until you unlock them by completing a goal adjacent to them.\n\n### Lockout bingo\n\nLockout Bingo is a variant of bingo where you can't validate a goal if another player already validated it. Since it's pretty hard to complete lines in this variant, the goal is to have more validated goals than the other players and not to form lines.

This page will go through multiple options for rebinding such as the feature accessible from the settings' tab of the [Launcher](/features/launcher).\n\nThough they are not directly related to the randomizer, the Ori speedrun community do have some rules regarding bind. If you are playing by yourself you can ignore them but when playing races, some organizator might want you to follow variants of these rules:\n* You can use third party software.\n* You can have a bind on every button, except for the scroll wheel.\n* Multibinds are allowed but macros are not (having multiple actions on the same button is allowed but every action has to resolve on the same frame).\n* You can’t bind the same action (dash, jump…) to more than 4 buttons (because the ingame rebinding tool doesn’t allow it either)\n\n## Controllers\n\nIn the vanilla game, there isn't any option to rebind your controls on controller. But rest assured, the randomizer does add a simple way to rebind your inputs!\n\nTo do so, go to the Settings tab of the [Launcher](/features/launcher) and then click on the Controller tab. From here, connect a controller and press any input.\nYou'll see a list of every possible actions. The one with a chain symbol are the one which already have a bind assigned to them and the one without this symbol are missing a bind.\n\nYou can click on \"Add bind\" for any action and press a button on your controller to bind that action to this button. You can also click on the X button near a bind in order to remove this bind from an action. For randomizer-only actions, it's also possible to hold your button while adding a bind in order to add a combination of buttons for this action.\n\nAny changes to binds are automatically saved. You can return to the default keybinds by clicking on the Reset All To Default button, at the end of the page.\n\n## Keyboard\n\nLike for Controllers, the randomizer add a way to rebind your inputs but, since it's already possible to rebind your controls in-game, the tool available in the Settings tab of the [Launcher](/features/launcher) only let you rebind randomizer-only actions.\n\nTo use this tool, once in the Settings tab of the randomizer, go to the keyboard tab. From here, you'll see a list of every randomizer-only action. The one with a chain symbol are the one which already have a bind assigned to them and the one without this symbol are missing a bind.\n\nYou can click on \"Add bind\" for any action and press a key on your controller to bind that action to this button and then click on the Save button. It's possible to press multiple buttons in order to bind an action to a button combination instead of a single key. You can also click on the X button near a bind in order to remove this bind from an action.\n\nAny change to binds are automatically saved. You can return to the default keybinds by clicking on the Reset All To Default button, at the end of the page.\n\nThe in-game rebinding tool is a bit limited, especiall because it doesn't support multibind. But if you go to AppData\\Local\\Ori and the Will of The Wisps, you will find the file KeyRebindings.txt. By opening this file with a text editor like Notepad, you can change your binds.\nEach action can be bound to 4 buttons, each one for a different control scheme. The file format is:\n\nAction: Button1, Button2, Button3, Button4\n\nTo specify a button, you have to use their Unity Keycode, which you can find on [this page](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html).\nSwitching from one control scheme to another will freeze your game a bit so you want your multibind on the same control scheme.\n\nDon’t forget to reload your game after modifying this file. Avoid using the in-game binding tool if you have edited this file by yourself since the in-game tool might delete some of your binds if you do so.\n\n## Third party solutions\n\nIf the first party and randomizer rebinding features aren't enough, there is a bunch of third party software you can use to bind your actions. The most popular one being [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) which lets you run a script in which you can specify what binds you want. AutoHotKey can also support macros. You can learn how to use this tool by reading the [documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm).\n\nIf you are playing on controller through Steam, the recommended tool is Steam Config. Caeyo has written a tutorial on how to use it, which you can found [here](https://www.speedrun.com/ori_wotw/guide/qc9ed).

You can also chain these sentry jumps but you will need to do at least one horizontal attack before doing an up slash again since you have a lot of recovery time when doing two up slashes in a row. \n\n<youtube-video id=\"GgXAUQraIM4\"></youtube-video>\n","dir":"/tutorials/movement","path":"/tutorials/movement/sentry-jumps","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-11-23T12:39:41.337Z","updatedAt":"2023-11-23T12:39:41.337Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1700743216527},"$loki":60},{"slug":"spear-jumps","title":"Spear jumps","tags":{"abilities":["spear","spike"]},"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"With Spear, you can make a jump mid-air without a double jump.
