If a new release is available, the launcher will inform you and let you decide if you want to update before starting your game.\n\nFrom here, you can also create a [multiplayer](/features/multiplayer) game by using the New Game button, access the wiki and other important location:\n\n* Open seeds directory: Open in your file explorer the folder in which all the seeds you generated are stored.\n* Open randomizer directory: Open the directory in which the randomizer itself is located (which is different from the folder of the launcher).\n* Create support bundle: Whenever something unexpected such as a crash happens, you can create a support bundle in which every important files for the developpers of the randomizer are stored. Share this with a dev to help them figuring out the bug.\n* GitHub: Open the Ori Rando's organization page which list every repositories related to the randomizer\n* Discord: An invitation to the Ori speedrun Discord to nerd out with the Ori players. Really useful to found players to play with or if you need help with anything!\n\n## Game\n\nThis tab will most likely appear as a number, next to the Home tab. It is where you can setup multiplayer games. To access this tab you need to be logged in, which is using [Discord](https://discord.com/). There is multiple way to play with other players which are all explained on the [multiplayer](/features/multiplayer) page.\n\n## Seed Generator\n\nFrom this tab, you can generate seed by using the [seed generator](/seedgen). A seed is a file containing informations about where every items are located and you need one in order to play the randomizer.\n\n## Stats\n\nHere, you will be able to see [statistics](/features/stats) about your current game such as your number of deaths, the time spend in each area or the number of pickup you collected. You have to load a savefile in order to see those information.\n\n## Settings\n\nIn the settings, you can both access [general settings](/features/settings) which let you enable different kind of options such as mouse aiming or restoring cutscenes as well as accessing a [key rebinding](/features/keybinds) system for both controller and keyboard.","dir":"/features","path":"/features/launcher","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-07-12T06:35:43.716Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-12T06:35:43.716Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1657607802791},"$loki":11},{"slug":"logic-helper","title":"Logic helper","tags":["feature"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"On the in-game map, you can cycle through different filters which show or hide different element.

Most of those items are only added if you chose specific options during the [seed generation](/seedgen):\n\n* Clean Water: make the water swimmable without taking any damage. In the base game this is done by completing the Wellspring Escape but in the randomizer you have to found this specific item\n* Teleporters: ley you teleport to the corresponding spirit well, even if you never went near it. You need to enable the Teleporters [header](/seedgen/headers) when generating a seed to add them in the item pool\n* Launch Fragments: once you find 3 launch fragments, the game will give you Launch. You need to enable the Launch Fragment [header](/seedgen/headers) in order to add these items to the item pool. When this header is active, the only way to get Launch from the seed is by finding the fragments\n* Relic: special items you need to collect in the World Tour [goal mode](/seedgen/goals) before going to the Shriek fight\n* Black Market Keystones: Out of keystones? No problem, buy as many as you need from Opher. Price increases for every keystone bought. You need to enable the Black Market [header](/seedgen/headers) in order to enable that behaviour\n* Jumpgrades: increase the height you get from a jump. You need to enable either the Bonus+ or Jumpgrades [header](/seedgen/headers) in order to add these pickups to the item pool\n* Skill Velocity: increase the speed of Dash, Burrow, Water Dash, Bash and Launch. This also increase the distance you'll travel when using those skills.

On top of adding the same items as Bonus Items, it also add way more powerful pickups:\n\n* Rapid Sword, Smash and Spear: increase the animation speed of these weapons, increasing your attack speed\n* Rapid Grenade: Grenade will charge faster\n* Melting Weapon: make that specific weapon able to melt ice and activate lanterns\n* Quickshot: just like the shard, let you shoot faster with your Bow\n* Uncharged Bash Grenade: Normally, you need to charge your Grenade from the ground before throwing it in order to be able to bash from it.

Collect the seeds from the Wellspring, Silent Woods, Baur's Reach, Mouldwood Depths, Luma Pools and Windswept Wastes, bring them to Tuley and plant them.  \n*Note*: Using the Quality-of-Life [preset](/seedgen/presets) shortens this quest: Through the combination of the Tuley Spawn and Autoplants [headers](/seedgen/headers), you only need to collect all the seeds, which will complete the quest.\n\n**Rebuilding the Glades**: Complete all of Grom's projects in Wellspring Glades.\n\n**Hand to Hand**:  \n- Talk to the Moki above the Kwolok's Hollow teleporter, near Hornbug.  \n- Bring the Moki's Map to Tokk, who's present in multiple areas: right of the teleporters in Glades, left of the East Waste TP, at Midnight Burrows entrance, in the room above the Reach teleporter and at the left of the Regenerate tree. Tokk is also present in Wellspring near the entrance of the middle room and near the East Pools teleporter but they will disappear from these areas after completing respectively the Lost Compass and Lost in Paradise quests.\n- Bring Tokk's bag to the Moki in the middle room of the Wellspring.  \n- Bring the Moki's herbs to Veral whose inbetween the Glades teleporter and the wind cavern at Baur's Reach, where the Spirit Trial is.  \n- Bring Veral's soup to the Moki at the campfire near the Baur's Reach teleporter.  \n- Bring the Moki's hat to the Moki near Twillen in Wellspring Glades.  \n- Bring the Moki's lantern to the Moki to the bottom left in Mouldwood Depths, near the Combat Shrine.  \n- Bring the Moki's silk to the Moki above the Luma Pools teleporter.  \n- Bring the Moki's spyglass to Motay in Wellspring Glades (NPC above Twillen).  \n- Bring Motay's Water to the Gorlek near Burrow Tree in Windswept Wastes.  \n- Bring the Gorlek's Mapstone Fragment to the Mapstone Altar in Windswept Ruins, behind where the Worm Escape starts.\n\nHand to Hand visualization:\n![Hand to Hand Map](/media/hand_to_hand_map.png)\n\n## Vanilla-only Quests\n\nThese quests aren't relevant for the randomizer for different reasons, but do exist in the vanilla game:\n\n**Guardian of the Marsh**: Find Kwolok in his Hollow.\n\n**Fallen Friend**: Leave the Silent Woods with Ku.\n\n**The Will of the Wisps**: Uncompletable (Final Quest).\n\n**The Silent Map**: Map out all of the Silent Woods, then show your work to Lupo in Wellspring Glades.\n\n","dir":"/tutorials/misc","path":"/tutorials/misc/quests","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-07-12T06:35:43.720Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-12T06:35:43.720Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1657607803131},"$loki":36},{"slug":"spear-wall","title":"Spear going through walls","tags":{"abilities":["spike","spear"]},"toc":[{"id":"redirect-heart","depth":2,"text":"Redirect Heart"},{"id":"pools-wheel","depth":2,"text":"Pools Wheel"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you use Spear close enough from a wall, it can go through it.

If you jump too soon, the jump won't come out and if you do it too late you will either use your double jump if you have one or not jump at all if you don't.\n\nIt is also possible to do it after [extending a jump with Spear](/tutorials/movement/extending-momentum-spear#jumps). The mid-air jump timing will be the same but you need to jump then use Spear in order to extend your jump momentum instead of simply using Spear from the ground.\n\n<youtube-video id=\"ZB8b_SzgEqc\"></youtube-video>\n","dir":"/tutorials/movement","path":"/tutorials/movement/spear-jumps","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-07-12T06:35:43.720Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-12T06:35:43.720Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1657607803224},"$loki":58},{"slug":"sword-jumps","title":"Sword jumps","tags":{"abilities":["sword","double jump"]},"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Sword jumps let you get more height from your double jump than usual.
