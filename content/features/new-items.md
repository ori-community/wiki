The items you can find in the randomizer are usually items from the base game like keystones, health upgrades or skills but the randomizer also adds some new items to the mix. Most of those items are only added if you chose specific options during the [seed generation](/seedgen):

* Clean Water: make the water swimmable without taking any damage. In the base game this is done by completing the Wellspring Escape but in the randomizer you have to found this specific item
* Teleporters: ley you teleport to the corresponding spirit well, even if you never went near it. You need to enable the Teleporters [header](/seedgen/headers) when generating a seed to add them in the item pool
* Launch Fragments: once you find 3 launch fragments, the game will give you Launch. You need to enable the Launch Fragment [header](/seedgen/headers) in order to add these items to the item pool. When this header is active, the only way to get Launch from the seed is by finding the fragments
* Relic: special items you need to collect in the World Tour [goal mode](/seedgen/goals) before going to the Shriek fight
* Black Market Keystones: Out of keystones? No problem, buy as many as you need from Opher. Price increases for every keystone bought. You need to enable the Black Market [header](/seedgen/headers) in order to enable that behaviour
* Jumpgrades: increase the height you get from a jump. You need to enable either the Bonus+ or Jumpgrades [header](/seedgen/headers) in order to add these pickups to the item pool
* Skill Velocity: increase the speed of Dash, Burrow, Water Dash, Bash and Launch. This also increase the distance you'll travel when using those skills. You need to enable either the Bonus+ or Skill Velocity [header](/seedgen/headers) in order to add these pickups to the item pool

## Bonus Items

Bonus items is an [header](/seedgen/headers) which add even more items to the item pool:

* Health Regeneration: regenerate your health over time
* Energy Regeneration: regenerate your energy over time
* Extra Double Jump: if you already found Double Jump, this pickup will give you a bonus jump for extra mobility
* Extra Air Dash: if you already found Dash, this pickup will give you another dash in the air for extra mobility
* Weapon Efficiency: reduces the energy cost of the corresponding weapon by half

## Bonus+

Like Bonus items, this is an [header](/seedgen/headers) which add more items to the item pool. On top of adding the same items as Bonus Items, it also add way more powerful pickups:

* Rapid Sword, Smash and Spear: increase the animation speed of these weapons, increasing your attack speed
* Rapid Grenade: Grenade will charge faster
* Melting Weapon: make that specific weapon able to melt ice and activate lanterns
* Quickshot: just like the shard, let you shoot faster with your Bow
* Uncharged Bash Grenade: Normally, you need to charge your Grenade from the ground before throwing it in order to be able to bash from it. This pickup let you bash uncharged grenades
* Extra Grenade: Normally, you can't throw multiple grenade since using a grenade while another one is already on screen will make the first one explode. This pickup let you throw multiple grenade without making the first one explode
* Splinter Grenade: Like the Splinter shard for Bow, this let you throw three grenades at once instead of just one

Bonus+ also add Jumpgrades and Skill Velocities to the item pool.
