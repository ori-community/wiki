The randomizer adds a few new commands you can activate by pressing multiple keys at the same time. These binds can be modified by using the [randomizer rebinding tool](/features/keybinds).

The most important special command is the [Custom Wheel](/features/custom-wheel) which you can open by pressing V on a keyboard or holding both shoulder button at the same time. Each commands listed bellow are then accessible through this wheel.

* Alt + P: Shows your progress in the seed (number of pickup collected, progress in [goals](/seedgen/goals) and [hints](/features/hints)).
* Alt + F5: Reloads the current seed.
* Alt + T: Shows the textbox of the last item you collected.
* Alt + C: Teleports you to end of the game if you already completed your goal. Currently, this is only used by the 3-line bingo utility [header](/seedgen/headers).
* Alt + /: Exit the randomizer instantly.
* Ctrl + Alt + D: Toggle Debug Controls.
* Ctrl + Alt + L: Toggles Cursor Lock.
* Ctrl + Alt + C: Show current coordinates.
* Ctrl + Alt + N: Toggles showing location names in spoiler filter (hold L in map).

Ctrl + Alt + 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are also special commands but they don't do anything by default. When playing plandos or by using some headers, these commands can be used to display additional information.
