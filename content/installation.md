## Prerequisites

The Ori and the Will of the Wisps Randomizer requires the latest version of the game on PC (either Windows Store or Steam is fine).

## Download

Download the lastest WotwRandoSetup.exe from [our website](https://wotw.orirando.com). Launch this file to install the randomizer.

Because the randomizer is working by injecting its own functionalities into the base game, anti-virus programs tend to view it as a malware. You will most likely need to whitelist the folder in which you installed the randomizer so your anti-virus is not preventing it from launching and installing.

## Steam

Since the randomizer needs to launch Ori and the Will of the Wisps, it needs to know where your Steam installation folder is. If you installed Steam in a non-default location, the randomizer installer will ask you for this path. You can change the Steam path later in your [settings](/features/settings) if needed.

## Windows Store

The randomizer should automatically detect that you have the Windows Store version of the game and prompt you to install the randomizer for it. If it does not, after installing, you can open [the settings](/features/settings) and activate the Use Windows Store option.

## After installation
