Presets are prebuilt settings you can use to quickly generate seeds. Once you have selected the presets you want to use, click on the Apply Presets button. This will override any previous settings. If you want to add those presets to the settings you have already selected, hold Ctrl to change the Apply Presets button to Merge Presets.

Here is a quick description of the available presets:

* Moki selects the [Moki](/seedgen/paths#moki) difficulty, the same headers as QOL and Hints plus these headers: Spawn with Sword, Teleporters, Teleporter Zone Hints, Vanilla Opher Upgrades, Black Market, Progress Helper. This is the recommended settings for players who finished the game at least once.
* Gorlek selects the [Gorlek](/seedgen/paths#gorlek) difficulty, the same headers as QOL and Hints plus these headers: Teleporters, Vanilla Opher Upgrades, Black Market, Progress Helper. This is the recommended settings for more advanced players who know a few more tricks. Check the [Paths](/seedgen/paths#Gorlek) page to learn what the logic expects when playing with these settings.
* Glitches enables all paths that use glitches. Glitches can only be use on [Gorlek](/seedgen/paths#gorlek) difficulty or above. Glitches that can be expected include: Sword and Hammer [sentry jumps](/tutorials/movement/sentry-jumps), [breaking walls from the wrong side](/tutorials/movement/wall-break), [Sentry burn](/tutorials/movementsentry-as-a-fire-source) and [Remove kill plane](/tutorials/location/feeding-ground-skip).
* Random Spawn selects the [Moki](/seedgen/paths#moki) difficulty (unless the [Gorlek](/seedgen/paths#gorlek) preset is also selected), applies the same headers as QOL and Hints plus the Teleporters, Opher Upgrades, Black Market, Progress Helper and Better Random Spawn header. This add teleporters to the item pool and remove some doors which you can only oppen from one side in order to make random spawn a better experience.
* QOL applies the following headers: Skippable Cutscenes, Spawn Tuley, No Branch, Autoplants, Teleport Refills. These quality of life improvements greatly reduce the time spent in cutscenes and dialogue.
* Hints applies the following headers: Zone Hints, Key Hints. This enables the [hints](/features/hints) feature.
