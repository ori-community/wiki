Sentry jump is one of the biggest glitches in Ori and the Will of the Wisps. By using an upslash with either sword or hammer and a sentry, you will make a big jump. You can use it while on the ground or mid-air but the timing is different for every variation.
Since you are using Sentry, you will spend 1 energy each time you do a sentry jump. Remember that you can only place 3 Sentries at a time so you will need to wait until your first Sentry expires before doing a 4th sentry jump in a row.

Framerate influences aerial sentry jump’s timing as well as the height you gain from sentry jumps. It’s recommended to cap your game at either 60 or 59 FPS for the best results.

## Grounded sentry jumps

If you want to use a sentry jump on the ground with Sword, you need to hold the up direction and then press sentry and sword on the same frame. Even if you still get height if you miss the timing, it’s recommended to set up a [bind](/features/keybinds) in order to perform them more consistently. Poor timing will result in less height gained, but is often still useful as not all applications require a full height sentry jump.

Hammer sentry jumps are a bit different: even if the inputs are the same as a sword sentry jump, the timing is not. For this one, you want to do an up attack with Hammer and use sentry before Ori starts to swing his hammer upward.

Hammer sentry jumps give you more height than Sword sentry jumps but you will have less air control. You also need to be immobile when doing a hammer sentry jump while a sword sentry jump can be performed while running.
The timing for Hammer sentry jumps is also less strict than Sword sentry jumps.

## Aerial sentry jumps

When used in the air, sentry jumps timing changes a bit.
For Sword sentry jumps, you want to first use your sentry and a couple frames afterwards input an up slash. You can chain them together to gain a lot of height.

Hammer aerial sentry jumps on the other hand are really different from grounded ones. The inputs are the same as grounded sentry jumps but you need to input sentry faster for the aerial variant.

This should not give you a lot of height by itself. What you want to do instead is start with a horizontal hammer attack and then do the sentry jump input.

After that, you can [extend](/tutorials/movement/extending-hammer) your sentry jump by doing a horizontal slash in the opposite direction to gain more height. Continue to do horizontal attacks in the opposite direction until Ori slows down. You can also chain these sentry jumps but you will need to do at least one horizontal attack before doing an up slash again since you have a lot of recovery time when doing two up slashes in a row.
