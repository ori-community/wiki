You probably already know that Launch is a pretty powerful skill but have you seen its true potential? There is a bunch of different techs you can use to access difficult pickups or simply going faster.

# Launch Swap

If you unequip Launch just after using it, your launch will be faster and will go further than usual. You can equip Launch again at any time after releasing your weapon wheel once.

# Boosted launch

When you change your direction in the air, Ori plays a little turnaround animation. If you launch during that animation, your launch will keep its initial speed a bit longer, making it go further.
In order to perform it: jump in a direction, press the opposite direction, launch in the same direction as your jump and keep holding the direction you pressed before using launch. Which means:
* Boosting to the right: jump right, press left, launch, keep holding left
* Boosting to the left:  jump left, press right, launch, keep holding right

# Weapon Launch

If you do a Launch upward and an upslash on the same frame, your Launch will go further. You can do it with both Sword and Hammer but Hammer Launch are more powerfull than Sword Launch. Both can be use midair but you will need to use your Sword upslash if you want to do a Sword Launch midair. It's recommended to set up a [bind](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Keybinds) to perform them more easily.
You can combine it with a Launch Swap to go even further.

# Terrawalk

When you use launch on a slope, you will maintain some of Launch's speed. This is mostly use in order to go faster.

# Ceiling launch

Like Terrawalk, if you use launch on a slope in the ceiling, you will maintain some of Launch’s speed. This is mostly use in order to go faster.
