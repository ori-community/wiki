Using Bow or Flap, you can regain movement during tree animations. The camera will remain at the tree, but you can keep moving blindly during the cutscene or teleport away, which will unlock the camera if it unloads the tree.

## With Bow

- Stand exactly in the center of the tree
- Aim and hold Bow
- Wait until the Bow is fully drawn out and doesn't move anymore
- Activate the tree

### Success

If Ori keeps holding the Bow, you have gained control and can start to move or teleport. If you want, you can cancel the Bow with Jump to avoid paying the energy cost.

### Failure

If Ori shoots the arrow away, you won't gain control. If the tree animation started instantly, you didn't wait until the Bow was fully drawn. If the tree animation starts a bit later, you weren't standing in the center.

### Quickshot

Quickshot reduces the time it takes to draw out the Bow, which means you can activate the tree sooner after starting to aim Bow.

## With Flap

- Stand exactly in the center of the tree
- Use Flap
- Activate the tree

### Success

If the tree animation starts instantly, you have gained control and can start to move or teleport.

### Failure

If the tree animation starts a bit later, you weren't standing in the center and won't gain control.

## Moonwalking

During the tree animation, you won't be able to turn around. Walking isn't affected by this, but you can only Dash in the direction you're facing. If you want to Dash during blind movement, you should turn around before activating the tree. With Bow, your direction is determined by where you aim. With Flap you can use a direction while ducking, which can turn you around without moving you so you can remain in the center after a visual setup.

## Positioning

You can get a decent success rate by guessing the center of the tree, but it's unlikely you'll succeed every time. You can use precise visual lineups to guarantee the correct position. Ori moves around less while ducking, which is why all examples here use alignments while ducked. Above the examples are multiple descriptions, you can pick the one that makes the most sense to you and use that for your setup.

### Double Jump tree

Ori's eye is entirely below the winding branch coming from the left, aligning with its shadow.
